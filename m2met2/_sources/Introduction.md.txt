# Introduction
## Call for participation
Recent advancements in speech signal processing, including speech recognition and speaker diarization, have led to a proliferation of speech technologies applications. Meetings are particularly challenging scenarios for speech technologies, given their varied speaking styles and complex acoustic conditions, such as overlapping speech, unknown numbers of speakers, far-field signals in large conference rooms, noise, and reverberation.

To advance the development of meeting transcription, several relevant challenges have been organized, such as the Rich Transcription evaluation and Computational Hearing in Multisource Environments (CHIME) challenges. However, the differences across languages limit the progress of non-English meeting transcription, such as Mandarin. The Multimodal Information Based Speech Processing (MISP) and Multi-Channel Multi-Party Meeting Transcription (M2MeT) challenges have contributed to advancing Mandarin meeting transcription. The MISP challenge addresses the problem of audio-visual distant multi-microphone signal processing in everyday home environments, while the M2MeT challenge focuses on solving the speech overlap problem of meeting transcription in offline meeting rooms.

Building on the success of the M2MeT challenge, we are pleased to announce the M2MeT2.0 challenge as an ASRU2023 Signal Processing Grand Challenge. In the M2MeT challenge, the evaluation metric is speaker-independent, meaning that we can only determine the transcription but not the corresponding speaker. To further advance the current multi-talker ASR system to practicality, the M2MeT2.0 challenge proposes the speaker-attribute ASR task with two sub-tracks performing in fixed and open training conditions. We provide a detailed introduction of the dataset, rules, evaluation methods, and baseline systems to further promote reproducible research in this field. The organizer will select top three papers and include them in the ASRU2023 Proceedings.
