ASRU 2023 MULTI-CHANNEL MULTI-PARTY MEETING TRANSCRIPTION CHALLENGE 2.0 (M2MeT2.0)
==================================================================================
Building on the success of the M2MeT challenge, we are pleased to announce the M2MeT2.0 challenge as an ASRU2023 Signal Processing Grand Challenge.
To further advance the current multi-talker ASR system to practicality, the M2MeT2.0 challenge proposes the speaker-attribute ASR task with two sub-tracks performing in fixed and open training conditions.
We provide a detailed introduction of the dataset, rules, evaluation methods, and baseline systems to further promote reproducible research in this field.
