FunASR: A Fundamental End-to-End Speech Recognition Toolkit
============================================================
.. image:: ./images/funasr_logo.jpg

FunASR hopes to build a bridge between academic research and industrial applications on speech recognition. By supporting the training & finetuning of the industrial-grade speech recognition model released on `ModelScope <https://www.modelscope.cn/models?page=1&tasks=auto-speech-recognition>`_, researchers and developers can conduct research and production of speech recognition models more conveniently, and promote the development of speech recognition ecology.
